<h5>Giving Back to the Community</h5>
<p>At GroupDocs we really value our developer community. With over 200,000 registered users across all our ventures, we know that our community also values us. We can't make it along to every event or user group, but we are always happy to help and support groups across the globe in any way we can. We sponsor several high profile user groups and provide swag and free GroupDocs licenses to make user groups a little more interesting.</p>
<h3>Looking For Sponsorship?</h3>
<p>If you are a user group leader or a member of a user group that would like some help, please <a href="/contact" rel="alternate">contact us</a></p>
